# Digit Classification Using Sklearn's `load_digits` Dataset

## Overview

This project is my first hands-on experience in Machine Learning where I built a classification model to recognize handwritten digits using the Scikit-learn `load_digits` dataset. The goal was to train and evaluate different models to classify the digits accurately and explore the fundamentals of model tuning and evaluation.

## Dataset

The `load_digits` dataset from Scikit-learn is a preprocessed dataset containing 1,797 samples of 8x8 pixel images of digits (0-9). Each image is represented by 64 features, and the task is to classify which digit is represented.

## Project Highlights

- Implemented multiple classification algorithm **Random Forest Classification**
- Visualized the dataset and model performance using **confusion matrices** and other evaluation metrics.
- Achieved the best accuracy using the **Random Forest Classifier**.
  
## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

## Results

The model achieves solid classification accuracy, with Random Forest emerging as the top performer. More details on the results and visualizations can be found in the code and notebook.
